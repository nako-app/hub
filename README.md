# Nako's public hub

Welcome to Nako :rocket:

Our hub allows to:

- Consult our public [Roadmap](https://github.com/nako-app/hub/projects/1)
- Learn about our SDKs
- Report issues or suggest features to the product

As a young product, the roadmap is subject to change often. The goal is to provide an overview of our ideas and what we're currently working on.


For any question/suggestions, please open a GitHub issue.

Thank you for using Nako :heart:
